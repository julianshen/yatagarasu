### What You Can Do with v1.0.0

```bash
# Run with Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/julianshen/yatagarasu:v1.0.0
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./config.yaml:/etc/yatagarasu/config.yaml yatagarasu:v1.0.0

# Run with Docker Compose (includes MinIO for testing)
docker-compose up

# Run from source
cargo build --release
./target/release/yatagarasu --config config.yaml

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/ready
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Proxy S3 requests
curl http://localhost:8080/public/image.png
curl -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" http://localhost:8080/public/video.mp4

# Hot reload configuration
kill -HUP $(pgrep yatagarasu)
# or via API
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:8080/admin/reload
```

### Known Limitations (Acceptable for v1.0)

1. **JWT Algorithms**: HS256 only (RS256/ES256 → v1.1)
2. **Caching**: ❌ NOT implemented in v1.0 (All files stream directly from S3 → Full caching in v1.1)
3. **Read-Only**: Write operations intentionally blocked (design decision)
4. **Pure Streaming**: No local buffering/caching (stateless design, horizontal scaling works)

## v1.1.0 - Enhanced Features 📋 **PLANNED**

**Target**: Q1 2026
**Focus**: Cost optimization through caching + enhanced authentication

### Planned Features

#### 1. Advanced Caching Layers 🔴 CRITICAL
**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** (Primary v1.1 goal)
**Effort**: HIGH (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] In-memory LRU cache (heap-based)
- [ ] Disk cache layer (persistent across restarts)
- [ ] Redis cache layer (distributed caching)
- [ ] Configurable cache hierarchy (memory → disk → Redis)
- [ ] Cache statistics dashboard
- [ ] Cache purge/invalidation API

**Why**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Dramatically reduce S3 GET request costs (can save 80-95% on AWS bills)
- **Performance**: Sub-10ms response times for cached content vs 100ms+ from S3
- **Scalability**: Reduce S3 backend load, enable higher request rates
- **Reliability**: Continue serving cached content during S3 outages

**Business Impact**: For high-traffic sites, caching can reduce monthly S3 costs from thousands of dollars to hundreds.

**Example Cost Savings**:
- Without cache: 10M requests/month × $0.0004/request = **$4,000/month**
- With 90% cache hit rate: 1M S3 requests × $0.0004 = **$400/month** (90% savings)

#### 2. Advanced JWT Algorithms
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: MEDIUM (2-3 days)

- [ ] RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
- [ ] ES256 (ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256)
- [ ] Multiple key support (key rotation)
- [ ] JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint support

**Why**: Support enterprise authentication systems that use RSA/ECDSA

#### 3. S3 LIST XML Response
**Priority**: LOW  
**Effort**: MEDIUM (3-4 days)

- [ ] XML serialization for LIST requests
- [ ] S3-compatible XML format
- [ ] Pagination support

**Why**: Full S3 API compatibility for clients expecting XML

#### 4. Enhanced Observability
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Effort**: MEDIUM (1 week)

- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Request/response logging with filtering
- [ ] Slow query logging
- [ ] Enhanced metrics (percentiles, SLOs)

**Why**: Better debugging and performance monitoring

#### 5. Additional Security Features
**Priority**: LOW  
**Effort**: MEDIUM (1 week)

- [ ] mTLS support (mutual TLS)
- [ ] IP allowlist/blocklist per bucket
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting (token bucket, sliding window)
- [ ] Audit logging

**Why**: Enterprise security requirements

### v1.1.0 Release Criteria

**🔴 CRITICAL - Must Have**:
- ✅ **In-memory LRU cache implementation** (Primary v1.1 goal)
  - Minimum: Heap-based cache for files <10MB
  - Target: 80%+ cache hit rate for static assets
  - Cost savings validation: Reduce S3 requests by 70%+
- ✅ **At least one persistent cache layer** (disk OR Redis)
- ✅ **Cache purge/invalidation API**
- ✅ All v1.0.0 features remain stable
- ✅ Backward compatible with v1.0.0 configurations
- ✅ Performance does not regress

**HIGH - Must Have**:
- ✅ RS256/ES256 JWT support

**Nice to Have**:
- S3 LIST XML format
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- mTLS support

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks development + 2 weeks testing

**Success Metric**: Demonstrate 80%+ reduction in S3 costs for typical workload

## v2.0.0 - Advanced Features 🚀 **FUTURE**

**Target**: TBD  
**Focus**: Advanced proxy features and optimizations

### Ideas Under Consideration

1. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time S3 event streaming
2. **Request/Response Transformation**: Custom hooks for modification
3. **GraphQL API**: Query S3 objects via GraphQL
4. **Object Transformation**: Image resizing, video transcoding on-the-fly
5. **S3 Write Support**: Enable PUT/POST with validation (optional, behind feature flag)

**Note**: These are ideas, not commitments. Prioritization based on user feedback.

## Development Principles

Throughout all versions, we maintain:

### TDD Discipline
- **Red**: Write failing test first
- **Green**: Implement minimum code to pass
- **Refactor**: Improve structure while keeping tests green
- **Commit**: Separate [STRUCTURAL] and [BEHAVIORAL] commits

### Quality Standards
- All tests must pass before committing
- No clippy warnings (cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
- Code properly formatted (cargo fmt)
- Test coverage >90%
- Clear, descriptive commit messages

### Architecture Principles
- Separation of concerns
- Explicit dependencies
- Minimal state and side effects
- Fail fast and loudly
- Security by default
- Performance by design
