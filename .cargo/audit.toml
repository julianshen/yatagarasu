    # RUSTSEC-2024-0437: proc-macro-error unmaintained
    # This crate is transitively pulled in by several dependencies.
    # It's unmaintained but there's no security vulnerability, just lack of maintenance.
    # Impact: None - this only affects compile-time proc-macro error handling.
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0437",

    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack - potential key recovery in RSA decryption
    # This only affects RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption operations.
    # Yatagarasu uses RSA for JWT signature VERIFICATION (public key ops), not decryption.
    # Impact: None - we don't use RSA private key decryption operations.
